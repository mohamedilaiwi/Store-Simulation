# Store-Simulation

## Description
One of my first Java Projects in High School. Mimicks a Store where a User is promptly asked what they want to purchase. Gives them the option of a few products, the quantity they want, and returns the total price. User can check what is in their shopping cart, and can continue adding more. Then, they proceed to check out, where the total price is returned. 

## Purpose
Introduced me to Polymorphism, Scope, Inheritance, and Encapsulation when I was first learning Java.
